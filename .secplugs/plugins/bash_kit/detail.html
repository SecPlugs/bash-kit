<h5>What is the <b>Bash Sample Kit</b>?</h5>

A collection of BASH shell scripts that run on Linux systems and allow you to submit URLs an files for analysis via the Secplugs platform.

<h5>How does it work?</h5>
The scripts simply use the REST calls via the common curl tool on all Linux systems. The scripts come preconfigured to use the anonymous API keys so they will work out of the box but its easy to change that to use your own API kyes and accounts.

<h5>How do I get started?</h5>
Simply download the package, extract the files and run them on any Linux system. 

After registering in Secplugs.com, Login with your username and go to Dashboard -> Admin Console to manage the plugin. Now, Go to Chrome browser, right click on the web secure icon, copy the API key from Admin console and close the plugin page.

Use can then use the Secplugs console to view activity, run reports and do deeper retrospective analysis.
