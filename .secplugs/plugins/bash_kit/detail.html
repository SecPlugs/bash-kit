<h5>What is the <b>Bash Sample Kit</b>?</h5>
<p>
A collection of BASH shell scripts that run on Linux systems and allow you to submit URLs and files for analysis via the Secplugs platform.
The plugin is designed ether for general usage as is or as a starting point for other projects.
</p>
<h5>How does it work?</h5>
<p>
The scripts simply use the REST calls via the common curl tool on all Linux systems. 
The scripts come preconfigured to use the anonymous API keys so they will work out of the box but its easy to change that to use your own API keys and account.
</p>
<h5>How do I get started?</h5>
<p>
Simply download the package, extract the files and run them on any Linux system. They will work out of the box with no configuration.
</p>
<p>
To use addtional features and the privacy of your own account, after registering in Secplugs.com, login with your username and create an API key to use with the scripts. 
Replace the key in the samples or create new scripts using these as an example.
Use can then use the Secplugs console to view activity, run reports and do deeper retrospective threat analysis.
