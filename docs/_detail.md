#### What is the Bash Kit?

A collection of BASH shell scripts that run on Linux systems and allow you to submit urls and files for analysis using the Secplugs platform backend.
The plugin is designed either for general usage as is or as a starting point for other projects.

#### What are the features?

- __File scanning__ - Scan files and directories for malware.
- __URL scanning__ - Send urls for analysis.
- __Realy simply to use__ - Works out of the box with the anonymous free tier usage.
- __Run anyware__ - Works on any system with a BASH shell, Linux, Mac OSX, Chrome etc
- __Secplugs Portal__ - With a registered API key you can access all the core Secplugs features via the portal.

#### How does it work?

The scripts simply use the REST calls via the common curl tool on all Linux systems.  
The scripts come pre-configured to use the anonymous API keys, so they will work out of the box (using the free tier default settings) but its easy to change that to use your own API keys and account.

#### How do I get started?

Simply follow the download link, download the .sh files run them on any Linux system. They will work out of the box with no configuration.  
Read the comments in the scripts or the [Quick Start](https://secplugs.github.io/bash-kit/docs/) to learn how to modify.  

To use additional features and the privacy of your own account, after registering in Secplugs.com, login with your username and create an API key to use with the scripts. 
You can then use the Secplugs console to view activity, run reports and do deeper retrospective threat analysis.
