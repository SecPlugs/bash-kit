##### What is the Bash Sample Kit?
A collection of BASH shell scripts that run on Linux systems and allow you to submit URLs and files for analysis via the Secplugs platform.
The plugin is designed ether for general usage as is or as a starting point for other projects.
##### How does it work?
The scripts simply use the REST calls via the common curl tool on all Linux systems. 
The scripts come pre-configured to use the anonymous API keys, so they will work out of the box (using the free tier default settings) but its easy to change that to use your own API keys and account.
##### How do I get started?
Simply follow the download link, download the .sh files run them on any Linux system. They will work out of the box with no configuration. 
Read the README.md and comments in the samples to learn how to modify.
To use additional features and the privacy of your own account, after registering in Secplugs.com, login with your username and create an API key to use with the scripts. 
Replace the key in the samples or create new scripts using these as an example.  
You can then use the Secplugs console to view activity, run reports and do deeper retrospective threat analysis.
